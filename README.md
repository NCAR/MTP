# MTP

The Microwave Temperature Profiler (MTP) is a HAIS instrument which was developed by JPL for the NSF/NCAR GV.

The [original VB6 code base](https://github.com/NCAR/MTP-VB6) from JPL that supports data processing and display was written in Microsoft Visual Basi 6. Since Microsoft has chosen to depracate Visual Basic, RAF has embarked on a re-write of some components of the original code. This repository contains those rewrites.
